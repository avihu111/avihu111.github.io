- I'm a Deep Learning researcher, working on deep speech processing at IBM Research.
- I'm also experienced in computer vision and clinical/biological data.
- I'm a M.Sc. graduate in Computer Science from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

### More Information
- I graduated B.Sc. in Computational Biology (gradueted Magna Cum Laude).
- I worked as an Algorithm Developer in Mobileye, focusing on Semantic Segmentation.
- During my M.Sc., I had the pleasure of working in [Daphna Weinshall's Lab](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~daphna/).
- My research focused on Low Budget Active Learning, as well as Semi-Supervised learning, Anomaly detection, Unsupervised Learning and various related fields.
- I was also a Research Intern at IBM AI for Healthcare, training Transformers on multi-modal health records dataset.
